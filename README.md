# Getting Started

This project is the basic set up of a React application with typescript. <br />

Overview of the basic project structure:<br />
 
components - basic building blocks<br />
views - more complex components, generally made up of several components + custom code<br />
shared - contains shared stuff such as style and layout constants<br />
assets - images and other static assets needed<br />
App.tsx - main entry point of the app, where the react DOM is mounted. <br />

## To Start

You will need to run the `yarn` command to install the dependencies in this project.  This is tested with yarn 
v1.22.4.

`yarn start` - runs the project (you may need to install yarn globally if not already installed on your machine)<br />

## Additional Guidance

The project includes the material-ui/core & material-ui/icons packages already, as well as react-select. <br />

Feel free to use these or any other libraries you'd like to install to complete the project.<br />

The project is set up to give you a starting point, but nothing is set in stone. If you would prefer to set things up differently go for it. <br />
